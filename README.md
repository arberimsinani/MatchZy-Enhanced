## ✨ What's Enhanced

Built for **[MatchZy Auto Tournament](https://github.com/sivert-io/matchzy-auto-tournament)** with extended APIs and events for tournament automation:

### Tournament Features
- 📡 **Extended event system** for real-time match tracking
- 🔧 **Match report API** with structured JSON state
- 🔄 **Thread-safe operations** for reliable automation
- 🤖 **Simulation mode** for testing and demos
- 🔁 **Event retry system** with automatic queue and recovery
- 📊 **Server tracking** with health monitoring and status events
- 💾 **Pull API** for direct match stats retrieval

### Queued match loads

`matchzy_loadmatch_url` (and `matchzy match load`) sent while the current series is in postgame does not load right away. The match is queued and loads after the series resets. The reply ends with `queued_match=<id>`, where `<id>` is the config file name without its extension (for `/api/matches/r2m1.json` that is `r2m1`), and the `matchzy_tournament_next_match` convar holds the same id. Sending another URL while one is queued replaces it.

The queued match is loaded only by the automatic reset after a series ends. It is dropped when:

- `css_restart` or `css_endmatch` resets the server. The reply includes `cleared_queued_match=<id>`.
- `matchzy_clear_queued_match` is run. This is server console / RCON only. The reply is `cleared_queued_match=<id>`, or `cleared_queued_match=none` when nothing was queued.

### Bootstrap config

A controller such as MatchZy Auto Tournament points a server at its bootstrap endpoint with two
server console / RCON commands:

```
matchzy_bootstrap_token "<token>"
matchzy_bootstrap_url "http://<controller>/api/servers/<server_id>/bootstrap"
```

The plugin then fetches that URL (token sent as `X-MatchZy-Token`) and runs the commands in the
payload. It fetches **about 1.5 seconds after the last change** to either value, not the moment
one of them is set: every change restarts the timer, and the fetch uses the URL and token current
when it fires. The two commands can be sent in either order and result in one fetch. On startup
the persisted URL and token are fetched straight away.

If the payload sets a `matchzy_server_id` that differs from the id in the bootstrap URL, or from
the id the server already had, a `[Bootstrap] WARNING` is logged. The payload is still applied.
This usually means the bootstrap URL is stale.

#### Logs don't contain secrets

Server logs, console output and chat never show secret values. The bootstrap, match and report
tokens, remote log / demo upload / backup header values, `sv_password`, `rcon_password` and any
other `*token*`, `*password*`, `*secret*` or `*header_value*` setting are logged as
`(hidden, N chars)`. The same goes for those values inside logged payloads, match configs, HTTP
responses, request headers and URL query strings (`?token=`). Logs are safe to share when asking
for help.

Older versions printed the token when saving it, e.g.
`[SaveConfigValue] Saved config for server '...': matchzy_bootstrap_token = <token>`. If you
shared logs from an older version, rotate the MAT `SERVER_TOKEN` and push the new token to your
servers.

### Multi-server setups sharing one database

Several servers can point at the same MySQL database. That is the point of a shared stats
database, and it now works for persistent config too.

Everything MatchZy persists — the `matchzy_server_config` table and the event retry queue — is
stored against an identity for the server that wrote it, so one server can no longer overwrite
another's values. Before this, whichever server wrote last won, and on restart every server on the
box loaded that one server's `matchzy_server_id`, bootstrap URL and remote log settings.

**The settings that are now per server**, i.e. each server keeps its own value:

- `matchzy_server_id`
- `matchzy_bootstrap_url`, `matchzy_bootstrap_token`
- `matchzy_remote_log_url`, `matchzy_remote_log_header_key`, `matchzy_remote_log_header_value`
- `matchzy_webhook_url`, `matchzy_heartbeat_url`
- `matchzy_report_endpoint`, `matchzy_report_token`, `matchzy_match_token`
- `matchzy_demo_upload_url`
- `matchzy_admins_url`, `matchzy_admins_refresh_seconds`
- `matchzy_chat_prefix`, `matchzy_admin_chat_prefix`
- all `matchzy_warmup_*` settings

The chat prefixes and the warmup settings are usually the same on every server, but they are
scoped the same way as the rest: one shared row for them was only ever an accident of the old
storage, and "last writer wins" is not a useful way to share a value. Set them per server, or
leave the existing shared value in place (see backwards compatibility below).

Genuinely global data — match, map and player stats in `matchzy_stats_*` — is untouched and stays
shared, which is why you point several servers at one database in the first place.

**How a server identifies itself.** The identity is derived from the bind address and the game
port, e.g. `cs2:27015`, `cs2:27025`, `cs2:27035` for three servers on a box named `cs2`. The bind
address is used when it names a real interface; CS2 servers are nearly always started with
`-ip 0.0.0.0`, which identifies nothing, so the machine name is used instead. Nothing has to be
configured for this to work, including before a controller like MAT has ever talked to the server.

Two things change a server's identity: changing its game port, and renaming the box. Neither
loses data — the server simply finds no row of its own and falls back to the shared pre-upgrade
row, and a controller re-pushes its values on the next configure. To pin a name that survives
both, set an explicit scope:

```
# in the server's start arguments (reliable: config.cfg may not have executed yet)
+matchzy_config_scope tournament-eu-3
```

`matchzy_config_scope` can also go in `config.cfg`, but the start-argument form is the one to
prefer and wins when both are set. It is never persisted to the database — a value that decides
which rows you read cannot itself be read from those rows.

The resolved scope is logged once at startup, e.g.
`[ConfigScope] Using scope 'cs2-server-2' (from start argument)`. The order is: the
`+matchzy_config_scope` start argument, the `matchzy_config_scope` convar, `-port` in the start
arguments, then the `hostport` convar once the server has activated. Start arguments are read from
`/proc/self/cmdline` on Linux. If none of these identify the server, MatchZy uses a key derived
from the server's install path (still distinct per server, never a key shared by the whole box)
and logs a warning — add `+matchzy_config_scope` when you see it.

**Upgrading from 1.4.26.** 1.4.26 could not read the start arguments inside the game process and
resolved every server on a box to the same `<host>:27015` scope, so those rows hold whichever
server wrote last. They are left in place but no longer read by any server that resolves a
different scope (reads only ever fall back to the pre-scoping shared row, never to another
scope). A controller re-pushes the correct values on the next configure. Once every server logs
its own scope you can remove the stale rows, e.g.
`DELETE FROM matchzy_server_config WHERE server_scope = 'cs2:27015';` — but only if no server on
that box legitimately resolves to that scope (a server without `+matchzy_config_scope` on port
27015 does).

**Backwards compatibility.** Rows written before this change are kept and treated as shared
fallbacks. A server reads its own row when it has one and the shared row otherwise, and only ever
writes its own row. So one server per database keeps working with no operator action, and a
multi-server setup keeps its current behaviour until each server writes its own values. The
schema migration runs automatically on startup and is a no-op once applied.

If you worked around this by moving servers to per-server SQLite files, you can move them back to
the shared MySQL database.

## Changes in this fork

This is [cs2-xpbot](https://github.com/arberimsinani/cs2-xpbot)'s fork of
MatchZy-Enhanced. It tracks upstream `dev`; the branch `xpbot` carries the
changes below on top, each written to be offered upstream.

- **The game can no longer change map before MatchZy does.** `HandleMatchEnd`
  raises `mp_match_restart_delay` to cover the delay it chose in every branch,
  not only when a demo upload URL is configured. Before this, a server
  recording without an upload URL waited `tv_delay + 25` s against the game's
  25 s default, and the game loaded the next map of the map group first, with
  the demo still being written.
- **A health endpoint.** From v1.4.34 the plugin answers `GET /health` with
  its version, config scope, uptime, map, the match it has loaded and its
  status, its database check, its event queue and a verdict of its own, so a
  control plane can ask the plugin whether it is loaded and working instead of
  reading the server's journal for a `LOADED` line. It listens on the
  abstract Unix socket `@matchzy-health-<scope>` from the moment it loads,
  with no configuration (`curl --abstract-unix-socket matchzy-health-<scope>
  http://matchzy/health` on the host; the scope is `matchzy_config_scope`,
  or `host:port` without one), and on TCP when `matchzy_health_port` names a
  port — bound to `127.0.0.1`, or to `matchzy_health_bind`. The report is
  captured on the game thread every 2 s and served from a background thread,
  so `snapshot_age_seconds` past 20 means the game thread has stopped: the
  plugin reports that, and a database it cannot reach, as `problems` with
  `ok: false`. The reply carries no secrets.
- **`css_forcewin <team1|team2>`** ends the map being played with the given
  team as its winner and lets the normal match-end path run: series score,
  clinch, demo and map change. `css_endmatch` drops the whole loaded series;
  this ends one map of it. Admin or console/RCON only; needs a live map.
